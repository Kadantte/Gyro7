# Faye Keller
Teen based in 🇮🇹  
Currently a busy highschool student; possibly a software engineer in the near future ●‿●

My interests range from [programming](https://github.com/pinkcig?tab=repositories) to [art](https://www.pinterest.it/fayekllr/) and music (link coming in the near future ≖‿≖).  
Node.js, Typescript, Go, and Rust are my favourite languages; despite that, I have a vast interest and love for everything tech related ≧◡≦

Feel free to contact me on Twitter at [@pinkcig_](https://twitter.com/pinkcig_), albeit there will be a little bit of a delay, as it is not my favourite platform.
