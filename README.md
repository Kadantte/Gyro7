# Faye Keller
Teen based in 🇮🇹  
Currently a busy highschool student 👩🏻‍🎓; possibly a software engineer 👩🏻‍💻 in the near future ●‿●

My interests range from [programming](https://github.com/pinkcig?tab=repositories) 🔧 to [art](https://www.pinterest.it/fayekllr/) 🎨 and [music](https://open.spotify.com/user/6kn5js3ss582nn47rqugdejqv) 🎵  
Node.js, Typescript, Go, and Rust are my favourite languages ✨; despite that, I have a vast interest, knowledge and love ♥ for everything tech related ≧◡≦

I can speak fluently in Italian 🇮🇹 and English 🇺🇸, but I can also wrap my head around French 🇫🇷 and Spanish 🇪🇸 if needed (^人^)  
Feel free to contact me on Twitter 🐦 at [@pinkcig_](https://twitter.com/pinkcig_), albeit there will be a little bit of a delay, as it is not my favourite platform (∩︵∩)
