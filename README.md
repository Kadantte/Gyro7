# 👋 Hello β
Hello, people know me as sach ( pronounced sác )  
I'm some random guy from Italy, I do stuff in Node.js, sometimes Rust and Elixir too.

# 🗃️ On-going projects
- [ ] [isoide](https://github.com/ya-sach1/isoide); a based haste server written in Elixir, with the aid of the Phoenix framework.
- [ ] [peek-a-boo](https://github.com/ya-sach1/peek-a-boo); a ( really bad ) card game with ghosts, made in Godot. Cool stuff.

# 🌸 Miscellania
- My preferred pronouns are she / her.
- I'm obsessed with my boo.
- I lose motivation and get angry easily.
- The Greek beta character is not placed there randomly, up to you to get what it means.
